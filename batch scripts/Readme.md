### Please note:
these are batch scripts that can be run in order to compile, mount and emulate, yet they a scraped from an earlier project, and might now work
In order to mount the files you need to download  [OSFMount](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html)
You also need a virtaul hdd file to mount, so just run wsl with the normal scripts, these are here for archival purposes, Knock yourself out

you still need alot of dependencies to run these scripts, so ill take care of that later
