# That Loader
- That Loader is a weekend project developed by me, trying to learn OS internals more thoroughly, developed using [UEFI-POSIX](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/posix-uefi) library, that will give me simpler, cleaner, easier code
# Project goals:
- Create a fully working UEFI bootloader
- Learn more about OS internals
- experiment with low level development
- experiment with linux environment development (which is the best)
# Notes:
